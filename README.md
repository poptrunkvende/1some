1.Jessica from st louis. I would like to be able to find a website that has coffee that I can not find locally in my area. 

2.Copper from Long Island. I drink coffee and share stories with family and friends while we sample different coffee. I would like a website that could deliver a good quantity and quality of coffee at a reasonable price. So my family and friends could enjoy ourselves.
